# Ways to present the workshop
1. Similar to Arduino; Present the code and have the workshop leader explain it
2. Present the code and have written explanations of the workings of the code
3. Present examples and briefly teach concepts, have the user create the program themselves based on PSEUDO-CODE
4. Switch from online-python.com to jupyter notebook for a more interactive programming experience.

Could have people complete the activities in their own time, but they have to come in to be marked and receive their certificate/badge.

I'll be developing the code/workshop on GitHub and transferring it to paper similar to how our workshops currently run. This way we can better track statistics.

The formatting and general presentability of GitHub makes it better for further explanation and teaching of the content.
