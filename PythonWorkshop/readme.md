# Ways to present the workshop
1. Similar to Arduino; Present the code and have the workshop leader explain it
2. Present the code and have written explanations of the workings of the code
3. Present examples and briefly teach concepts, have the user create the program themselves based on PSEUDO-CODE

# Setting up your workspace
Get started with programming! Python is easy to learn and widely used in fields such as data science and analysis, machine learning, and electronics such as Micro:Bit and STM32 with the MicroPython extension.

# What is Python?
What is Python? Python is a high-level, object-oriented programming language. It uses an “interpreter” which allows you to dynamically write and execute code, opposed to having to write and then “compile” code like with Java, C based languages, and many more.

The way code is written (called the “syntax”) of Python is easy to grasp and more forgiving than most other languages, such as not having to worry about allocating or freeing computer memory for example. However, the interpretation performed by Python means it’s slower to execute code than Java or C/C++.

# Before we begin
**Commenting**

Commenting is when you add text into the code that is ignored by the interpreter or compiler to help anybody reading it understand what is happening.
- For Python, you can start a comment with `#`
- As you progress through the activities and complexity increases, try commenting your code. e.g:
 ```Python
# The interpreter reads from top to bottom and left to right
# These are comments, so it won't read these lines.

Some Code  # This is also a comment. The interpreter stops reading beyond the #
 ```
- A useful comment is one that can describe what a component does or what its purpose is in the system.

**Pseudo-Code**

Pseudo-code is an important part of breaking down and solving a problem. While it may seem like an extra step here, it can save you countless hours when you’re smashing out a programming assessment!
- Pseudo-code is a description of the steps needed to develop the program, algorithm, or system at hand, in plain language that is easy for humans to read, essentially building steps at a high level to make writing the code easier! There’s no specific syntax to follow, so you can write it out in whatever way helps you. 
- For some of the activities provided in this workshop, pseudo-code will be provided to help you start the problem.
